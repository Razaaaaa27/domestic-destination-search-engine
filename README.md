# Triply Search 

This project is a search engine designed to help users explore domestic travel destinations. The engine enables users to search for destinations based on specific criteria, such as location, type of destination (e.g., beach, mountain, historical), and other relevant filters.

## Features

- **Search by Location:** Allows users to search destinations by city, province, or region.
- **Search by Category:** Filters available to find specific types of destinations (e.g., natural parks, cultural landmarks, beaches).
- **Interactive UI:** Simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.
- **Results Display:** Displays a list of destinations based on the search query with relevant information.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core backend language used for the search engine logic.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for building the web application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the frontend of the search engine.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database used to store destination data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to install the following:

1. **Python** (Version 3.6 or above)
2. **Flask**: Install Flask by running the command:
    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```
3. **SQLite**: Install SQLite if you haven't already, though SQLite comes pre-installed with Python.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/domestic-destination-search-engine.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd domestic-destination-search-engine
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the search engine.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users can input search queries (location, type, etc.) in the search bar.
2. **Processing**: The search engine processes the input query by filtering the destination database based on the search criteria.
3. **Results**: The engine returns relevant results such as destination names, locations, descriptions, and images.
4. **Display**: The results are displayed on the webpage in a user-friendly list format.

## Usage

- Enter a destination name or location in the search bar and click "Search."
- Filter destinations by category (e.g., beaches, mountains, historical sites).
- View detailed information about each destination by clicking on the name of the destination.

## Sample Data

Here are a few sample queries you can try:

- **Search for "Bali Beach"**: Will show beach destinations in Bali.
- **Search for "Historical Sites Jakarta"**: Will filter and show historical landmarks in Jakarta.
- **Search for "Mountain"**: Will display destinations categorized under mountains.
